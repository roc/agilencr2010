		Agile teams are constrained to work in a time box or shorter iteration cycles. Typical teams tend to have more developers than testers. Over the years many agile teams have come to practice unit testing and TDD, but teams still heavily depend on the tester to catch Bugs. Many testers when asked what makes them a good tester tend to answer "The number of defects they find while developers tend to be happy with coding and not looking at the overall quality of the product. While a handful of teams in the world have reduced this gap, most Agile teams still try to fight out the issues between developers and testers.
