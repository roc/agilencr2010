	  Today there is much confusion as to where to begin with managing projects. You can choose a standardized method like PMBOK or Prince2. You can choose and Agile method like XP, Scrum, or Kanban. Even within Scrum there is heated discussion as to which type of Scrum is best. In this provocative talk, Jesse Fewell says none of it matters; noone wants to admit that very formal method has both its successes and its failures.
	  Published in PM Network magazine and presented at conferences across India, this presentation has inspired and irritated Agile practitioners of all walks. Come hear what exactly will make your project successful, regardless of which method you implement.
