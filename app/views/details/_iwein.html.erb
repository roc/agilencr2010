		There are many reasons for Offshoring to fail. Some of which are overcome by working with ADD, but some of which are not.

		As an experienced developer, architect and Scrum Master in both successful and failing offshoring teams Iwein Fuld would like to gather the knowledge of experts experienced in this field to produce a set of factors that determine the success or failure.
