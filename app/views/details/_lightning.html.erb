A Lightning talk is a short presentation given at a conference or a similar forum. Unlike other presentations, lightning talks last only a few minutes and several will usually be delivered in a single period by different speakers.
The length of talks are usually between 1 and 10 minutes. In order to allow rapid changes between speakers, slides are either discouraged or a single computer running a presentation program is used by all speakers.

At AgileNCR we will be looking forward to hearing tips, experiences and anecdotes from attendees. The floor will be thrown open in this slot and anyone who is interested in sharing something can grab this opportunity. The only constraint is that the speaker should not take more than 10 minutes.
