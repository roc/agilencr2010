		Test Driven Development is all the hype, but how many are really using it? The biggest challenge for developers who wants to go test driven is to get started. But if you have never tried it before, it may seem an insurmountable task to write the first test.
		This workshop encourages people to bring their own laptop and try it out for themselves. An editor - preferably for Java - must be installed already. Alternately, participants can follow the on-screen work of my laptop, as I go through a simple TDD run.
		Before, during and after I will describe why and how we should employ TDD using arguments from Kent Becks books on XP and TDD.
