		  Test Driven Development should have been coined Test Driven Design instead - Kent Beck has conceded this. Writing the test first gives you the freedom and confidence to refactor your code and change the design at any moment - and you should change it at any moment! Design is best done based on experience - BDUF (Big Design Up Front) is dead as the Dodo.
	  This workshop will present a larger example of TDD where the design changes as the application grows - and the whole thing is supported by writing test first.

		Participants will see how easy and troublefree it is to change the design of work-in-progress once we adopt TDD. It's not only about writing test first, it's also writing agile code that is inherently easy to redesign - this is what the TDD mindset brings along.
