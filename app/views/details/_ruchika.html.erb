		Ruchika Goyal is an agile enthusiast who not only uses her knowledge and skills
		in a distributed agile environment but also helps non-agile teams to adapt to
		this fast growing phenomenon. She is very well versed with agile software
		development methodologies like Scrum and XP. Starting her career in
		telecommunications, she was eventually lured to the exciting and dynamic world
		of web application development. She loves learning about
		new technologies and using that experience to achieve simplistic
		solutions to complex problems.

		Being an agile developer Ruchika believes in the path - "Explore, adopt, retrospect and innovate". And of course the last but not least step is "disseminate". We started with Scrum + XP combination in our project. It worked like a charm till there was enough work to fill the product backlog. As we geared towards the end of the project, and we had very few features or functionalities and more of bugs or improvements which come alowly into the process. Sometimes the developers were too busy even to check their facebook account (Most important thing ;)) and sometimes they had too much time. It was becoming very difficult to track and maintain the progress. Then we came to know about a new process called 'Kanban' and started adapting it slowly.
		In this session I would like to share our experiences with the community. On the road to Kanban, we first introduced ScrumBan, a mix of scrum and Kanban. Eventually, we completely moved to Kanban. The main take aways for the audience are:
		<br/><br/>
		1. When Kanban can be used.<br/>
		2. Transitioning from Scrum to Kanban<br/>
		3. Adaptations in Kanban
