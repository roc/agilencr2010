		Agile practices and principles are very well understood in the context of Software Development and Project Management. However, Agile is not limited to Software Development. The Agile principles and practices could be very well used in functions such as sales, operations, team-building, management, etc. During the session, we want to pick-up some of the practices from Scrum, XP, Lean and Kanban and discuss how those practices could be used to build and manage a company in functions other than software development.
		Some questions that we want to raise; and try to answer with respect to how they could potentially be done in an Agile company are:
  <br/><br/>
		- How to fail cheap and fast?<br/><br/>
		- How to identify & eliminate waste?<br/><br/>
		- How to make effective decisions, without being afraid; and in the face of ambiguity?<br/><br/>
		- How to inspect and adapt at company level?<br/><br/>
		- How to define company strategy and vision?<br/><br/>
		- How to introduce transparency at company level?<br/><br/>
		- How to ensure continuous learning & improvement?<br/><br/>
		- How to measure employee satisfaction?<br/><br/>

		During the session, we also discuss the characteristics of an Agile company, some pitfalls and how to reach the "state of being Agile" company.
